This file gives a brief overview of what to do with the documents in order to get the website started locally.

1. Download all files and save them in the same folder (local computer).

2. To edit any of the files, open them in an Editor (I use notepad++ but others work to).

3. To see the output open an html file (main_page) via double click.

The CSS file determines the style of the website while the others determine the content. Each tab needs an own html file.
