    "While the GDELT project’s data have been widely used in social science research, it is important to be aware of\n",
    "what it is and, accordingly, what it is not. The project captures an extensive picture of what is reported which\n",
    "might diverge from what truly happened. This means that the data might include both false-positive as well as\n",
    "numerous mentions of the same incident. In a reduced version, the project limits its data to one record of each\n",
    "event type between actors per day. Additionally, the data are usually weighted by the total number of event\n",
    "records collected per day since a higher number of events today than 20 years ago might just be a reflection\n",
